# Collection of Crafts

Collection of Crafts is a website showcasing a range of art and craft ideas aimed for kids but in which the whole family can enjoy making. The site will be targeted towards users who are looking for craft ideas, inspiration and activities to do with children. Furthermore, I want to build a plaform that brings a sense of a community and ongoing involvement, something that I believe is missing from the many text heavy sites available. The ultimate goal is to be the primary resource for users wanting ongoing art and craft projects.

The sites look and feel, ease of navigation and content should deliver inspiration to the user. The aim is to update the onsite content periodically enabling previous users to come back and gain further inspiration. There with be a feedback 'voting' form to get the user involved in future carft ideas along with a 'stay in touch' form allowing users to sign up to periodic newsletters giving them that timely reminder about the site and hopeful return of traffic.

## Design

 ### Structure
  - The site will be made up of an initial landing page, 4 themed art and craft project idea pages, a picture board gallery page, a vote form page and a stay in touch sign up form.
  - Every page will be in a consistant layout aiding simple usability. 
    1. Navigation bar at the top.
    2. header image and title of the page.
    3. Core content of the page.
    4. Social media footer at the bottom.
    5. Consistant colour scheme throughout each page.
 ### Colour Scheme
 - Colour scheme of the site designed using: https://coolors.co/
 - The header, nav bar and footer make up the main colour of the site being lavender gray, this is also supported as a background colour where needed. 
 - The heading and font colour is oxford blue with a shadow on heading of white and when hovered over link text.
 - Each page of the site is supported with a different accent colour so the user has a visual reference point and not solely relying on reading the text.
 ![Site Colour Scheme](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/colour-scheme.png)
 ### Typography
 - The [Permanent Market](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker?query=perma) font is used for the headings throughout the site with Cursive as the fallback. Permanent Marker brings relevant styling for a craft webite.
 - The [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) font is used for the content of the site with Sans-Serif as the fallback. Open Sans works well against the headings giving the font clear lines to read.
 ### Imagery
 - Imagery is very important across the site as it will be a source of inspiration to the user. It needs to be eye catching, bold and be relevant to the page content.
 - Each page has a hero image at the top, below the heading and navigation bar. This image sets the theme of the page e.g. Homepage has a collection of craft tools, Stay In Touch page has a letter etc. 
 - Imagery is also used in the contents of the four themed craft project pages to give the user a picture representation of the craft idea. On the Picture Board page images are the focal point to showcase the communities finished work.

 ### Responsive Site
 - The site is responsive across various screen sizes from desktop, tablet and through to mobile. The user needs to be able to easily read, navigate and interact with the content across various devices.
 - Specific screen break points are: iphone 5 up to ipad (320px - 767px), ipad up to ipad Pro (768px - 1023px), ipad Pro to desktop (1024px +).
 - The use of both Grid and Flexbox CSS has helped create a responsive site. Which CSS tool used per page is based on the layout of the content.

 ### Accessibility
 - All images have an alt attribute taking into account users who are visually impaired. The site has contrasting background colours to text enabling an easy read and themed colourways have been set on the landing page which flows through to the specific pages. Semantic HTML has been used to support machines understand the layout of the site. All links have hover over effect.
 
## Features Left to Implement
 - The form for uploading images to the Picture Board page. Need an understanding of backend technology. The images then supplied in by the user will need to be sensor checked before gaining permission to be loaded onto the site. Terms and conditions would need to be outlined on the site.
 - The form for voting on the Vote page. Need an understanding of backend technology.
 - The form for signing up to email newsletters on the Stay In Touch page. Need an understanding of backend technology. Once the users details have been received, a periodic email is to be sent back to the users supplied email address. Terms and conditions and GDPR rules would need to be outlined.
 - Ongoing periodic update to the imagery and craft content on the site to keep the site refreshed and inspiring.
 - Further craft ideas to be added to the four craft pages to increase the amount of content and provide a wider choice for the users.
 - Future link to retailer sites on the materials needed section in the craft page. This will help users know where to buy the materials from.

## Technologies Used

 ### Languages Used
  - [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
  - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

 ### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
  - Balsamiq: used to create the wireframe during the design process.
  - Gitpod: used for writing the code and using the command line to commit and push to GitHub.
  - Git: used for version control through the gitpod terminal to commit to Git and push to GitHub.
  - GitHub: used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. Used to host repository.
  - Hover.css: used for the links in the nav bar to underline and turn font colour white. Used to underline font in the buttons. Curser turns to sa hand icon when hovered over link.
  - Google Fonts: used to import the 'Permanent Market' with 'Cursive' as the fallback font on headings and the 'Open Sans' with 'Sans-Serif' as the fallback font on the content.
  - Font Awesome: used for icons in the footer and icons within the content of the site for aesthetic and UX purposes.
  - Favicon.io: used to generate the favicon icon of the site.

## Testing
 - Once the site was completed I reviewed each feature of the site listed above and checked that:
   - all the links work i.e. nav links take the user to the correct page, header logo clicks back through to the home page, footer social media icons open up the site in a new tab.
   - the link hovers work when curser rolls over, either in the nav bar will underline and text change to white, or images border in Picture Board page will expand.
   - the pages are responsive and look as intended based on the screen size, with mobile, tablet and desktop the main breakpoints.
   - the forms submit with the correct data and 'required' propoerty used where needed.
   - I asked three family members to test out the site too by sending them the url link and provide honest feedback where possible.
 ### Google Inspect
  - I coded the site using mobile first design. Constantly using Google Inspect to check my layout, make amendments, re-check and delivering an end result that fits the brief and user goals. 
 ### Validator Testing
  #### HTML - 
   - One error returned when checking the index.html page, on line 70 I was missing a ; after the &amp code. Corrected. There were two warnings highlighting sections on lines 49 and 98 lacked headings. Headings not relevant for the section. Upon research I also noted that I should have used the section element to apply a class for the container div, and not use a div as a direct child for this reason.
   ![Landing Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-landing-page.JPG)
   - reuse.html page returned an error whereby I had used duplicate ids for my form: upload file button. This has now been corrected to show no errors or warnings. 
   ![Reuse Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-reuse-page.JPG)
   - seasonal.html page returned no errors or warnings. 
   ![Seasonal Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-seasonal-page.JPG)
   - learn.html page returned no errors or warnings. 
   ![Learn Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-learn-page.JPG)
   - rainy.html page returned no errors or warnings. 
   ![Rainy Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-rainy-page.JPG)
   - No errors returned on the picture_board.html page. There were two warnings highlighting sections on lines 62 and 73 lacked headings. Headings not relevant for these sections.
   ![Picture Board Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-picture-board-page.JPG)
   - No errors returned on the vote.html page.
   ![Vote Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-vote-page.JPG)
   - No errors returned on the stay_in_touch.html page. There was one warning highlighting section on line 62 lacked heading. Headings not relevant for the section. Upon research I also noted that I should have used the section element to apply a class for the container div, and not use a div as a direct child for this reason.
   ![Stay In Touch Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-validator-stay-in-touch-page.JPG)
 #### CSS - 
  - One error returned on line 171 as I used the CSS property 'all: unset' which reset the properties to their initial value. I believe this is a valid property however in order to remove the error, I replaced the code with transform: none and position: relative in order to show the nav bar links on screens over 1024px. Corrected and no errors in the code. 
  ![CSS Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-css-validator.JPG)
  - Five warnings were displayed, one due to using external style sheet, four warnings for an unknown vendor extension which I have created to help with the background colour maintenance of the site and nav bar open and close functionality.
  ![CSS Validator Warnings](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/w3c-css-validator-warnings.JPG)
 ### Performance Testing
  - Tested the site on Google Developer Tools Lighthouse for desktop and mobile with good results on desktop. However mobile has lower performance due to size of the hero image and about us image. My concern with lowering the resolution to boost page load speed is the risk of the image being blurred. Given how mobile performance continues to improve, I dont believe this is a concern.
 ![Lighthouse Results Desktop](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/performance-result.JPG)
 ![Lighthouse Results Mobile](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/collection-of-crafts/blob/master/readme-content/performance-result-mobile.JPG)
  - Tested on [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) which helped me with accessibility, making sure my layout and design worked well with screen readers.
 ### User Stories Testing
  - First time user when on the landing page will see the heading and main hero image to get an understanding of the site. There is an About Us section which provides more information. Below are craft tiles with link buttons and images that relate to the type of craft on that clicked through page. The content is consistant throughout the site with font in an easy to read style. The images and craft content provide ideas and inspiration to the user which should develop into the site being used as a continued craft resource. 
  - Returning user is able to locate the Picture Board page in order to upload an image of their craft. The functionality of this is not possible at present but has the HTML and CSS in place once the backend data have been created. There are many craft ideas on the site spanning four themes so the user has plenty of resource to get more craft ideas and inspiration. Social media links in the footer provide access to the relevant platform that opens up in a new tab. The Vote page is correctly working and allows the returning user to submit their desired choice of craft for the next monthly update.
  - Frequent user is able to easily navigate to the craft pages either using the nav bar or link buttons on the landing page. The Picture Board page is designed into sections of the types of craft and has a scroll element allowing the community to continue to upload their finished craft. A frequent user is able to sign up to the periodic craft newsletter on the Stay In Touch page by providing their contact name and email address. The craft content and voting questions will be updated periodically. The code within this section is semantically written up with comments allowing the developer to easily navigate to the right part of the HTML. 
 ### Further Testing
  - Site tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari across the responsive page break sizes. Both Flexbox and Grid used in CCS to structure the content with each property used based on the type of layout needed e.g. on the landing page the page link containers use Flexbox which adaprt to screen size, whereas on the craft pages, Grid is used and duplicated on each craft idea and craft page.
  - Site tested on mobile, both Samsung Note 10 and iphone 10.
  - All links on the site tested and directed to the correct page.
 ### Bugs
  - After testing the site using Google Inspect for responsiveness, there did not appear to be any layout issues, however using a mobile, specifically Samsung Note 10, the icons on the Vote and Stay In Touch page would fall across two lines. Margins and padding had to be amended to suit.
  - I struggled with maintaining a good aspect ratio on my image divs. Upon research I wanted to use aspect-ratio css propoerty however it is not supported on Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera Android, Safari on iOS and Samsung Internet. Instead I used width and height ratios and implements various brak points that would suite each pages content.

## Deployment
