# Collection of Crafts

Collection of Crafts is a website showcasing a range of art and craft ideas aimed for kids but in which the whole family can enjoy making. The site will be targeted towards users who are looking for craft ideas, inspiration and activities to do with children. Furthermore, I want to build a plaform that brings a sense of a community and ongoing involvement, something that I believe is missing from the many text heavy sites available. The ultimate goal is to be the primary resource for users wanting ongoing art and craft projects.

The sites look and feel, ease of navigation and content should deliver inspiration to the user. The aim is to update the onsite content periodically enabling previous users to come back and gain further inspiration. There with be a feedback 'voting' form to get the user involved in future carft ideas along with a 'stay in touch' form allowing users to sign up to periodic newsletters giving them that timely reminder about the site and hopeful return of traffic.

## Design

- ### Structure
 - The site will be made up of an initial landing page, 4 themed art and craft project idea pages, a picture board gallery page, a vote form page and a stay in touch sign up form.
 - Every page will be in a consistant layout aiding simple usability. 
   1. Navigation bar at the top.
   2. header image and title of the page.
   3. Core content of the page.
   4. Social media footer at the bottom.
   5. Consistant colour scheme throughout each page.
- ### Colour Scheme
 - Colour scheme of the site designed using: https://coolors.co/
 - The header, nav bar and footer make up the main colour of the site being lavender gray, this is also supported as a background colour where needed. 
 - The heading and font colour is oxford blue with a shadow on heading of white and when hovered over link text.
 - Each page of the site is supported with a different accent colour so the user has a visual reference point and not solely relying on reading the text.
 ![Site Colour Scheme](#)
- ### Typography
 - The Permanent Market font is used for the headings throughout the site with Cursive as the fallback. Permanent Marker brings relevant styling for a craft webite.
 - The Open Sans font is used for the content of the site with Sans-Serif as the fallback. Open Sans works well against the headings giving the font clear lines to read.
- ### Imagery
 - Imagery is very important across the site as it will be a source of inspiration to the user. It needs to be eye catching, bold and be relevant to the page content.
 - Each page has a hero image at the top, below the heading and navigation bar. This image sets the theme of the page e.g. Homepage has a collection of craft tools, Stay In Touch page has a letter etc. 
 - Imagery is also used in the contents of the four themed craft project pages to give the user a picture representation of the craft idea. On the Picture Board page images are the focal point to showcase the communities finished work.
