# Collection of Crafts

Collection of Crafts is a website showcasing a range of art and craft ideas aimed for kids but in which the whole family can enjoy making. The site will be targeted towards users who are looking for craft ideas, inspiration and activities to do with children. Furthermore, I want to build a plaform that brings a sense of a community and ongoing involvement, something that I believe is missing from the many text heavy sites available. The ultimate goal is to be the primary resource for users wanting ongoing art and craft projects.

The sites look and feel, ease of navigation and content should deliver inspiration to the user. The aim is to update the onsite content periodically enabling previous users to come back and gain further inspiration. There with be a feedback 'voting' form to get the user involved along with a 'stay in touch' form allowing users to sign up to periodic newsletters giving them that timely reminder about the site and hopeful return of traffic.
